# What means MK Knowledge Graph

![Logo](MK_KnowledgeGraph_Logo.png)

Hello!  

My name is [Maciej Krzywda](https://github.com/mkrzywda). I created this repository to share a weekly set of links that I found valuable and inspiring. I hope that you'll like it! 

I looked for the best name for space in which I like work and do research. Databases, Graph Algorithms and broadly understood Artificial Intelligence crossing with functional programming like Haskell is a topics in which I work daily. So, Graphs which is the most humanity data structure (because shows connection between nodes which representate area in which I working) make the big Knowleadge Graph, so I think this is a the best name which I can think up :smile:

So sum up **MK Knowledge Graph** is a space in you will be can find articles/sample of code about _**Artificial Intelligence**, **_Knowledge representation and reasoning_**, **_Databases_**, **_Graphs Algorithms_**, **_Neural Networks_**, **_Federated Learning_**, _**Programming Language**_(_C++_, _Haskell_, _Rust_,_Python_).

See also [Summary](Summary.md) of all links.
